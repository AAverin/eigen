# Using Emission in Eigen

Ideally: This is not something you should be doing for day-to-day development,
the Example App inside this repo should provide enough to work with, and can
be worked on to expand on specific for development.

### Switching to Local Packager in Eigen

In Eigen, inside the Simulator, hit `~` to open the Admin panel. Inside the panel
tap `Use local Emission packaging server`.
