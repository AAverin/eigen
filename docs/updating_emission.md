### Updating Emission steps

## Get Emission's code in the App

* Ship a [new Emission release](https://github.com/artsy/emission#deployment)
* Update Eigen's `Podfile.lock` via `bundle exec pod update Emission yoga React/Core`
( _note the lower-cased `yoga`: this is necessary due to Mac filesystem case-insensitivity. Additionally, the yoga and React/Core updates may not be necessary depending on your release._ )

## Get Emission's to compile

If it doesn't compile out-right:

* If the error exists inside React: look into what post-install hooks run inside the Emission repo.

  E.g. inside [package.json](https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/master/package.json), [scripts/post_*.sh](https://github.com/artsy/emission/tree/master/scripts) and the example [app's Podfile](https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/master/Example/Podfile). They may need to be applied here.

* If the error exists inside Emission: Look at the Emission test app [AppDelegate](https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/master/Example/Emission/AppDelegate.m) to see how all of the
  available functions are wired up.

## Get Emission runtime 

Does it crash on launch? 

* Might need to add new settings to [the `AREmissionConfiguration` object](https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/master/Pod/Classes/Core/AREmission.h) in Eigen's side. Ideally these should get raised by compiler warnings, but you never know.

* A native module may have new exposed callbacks which are required to be set up on launch.
