## Getting Setup

### Fork and Clone

Follow the instructions in [the README](https://github.com/artsy/eigen).

### Running Tests

We can only run tests in one specific environment, today that is `10.3` on an iPhone 6. This is because we use visual snapshots for UI regressions.

You can install the iOS 10 SDK by opening Xcode's preferences, going to "Components" then downloading "10.3.x".

Once it's all downloaded, it will show up in the dropdown in the top left corner.

#### To run test in Xcode

Tap `cmd + u` to run all tests, use `ctrl + alt + cmd + g` to run the last set you clicked on via the GUI. 

#### Command line

You can run tests via the CLI using:

```sh
make test
```

### Certificates

We use Xcode's auto-codesigning. It should magically "just work" if you log in to Xcode with an iTunes account
which is on the Artsy team.

We have [cert troubleshooting here](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/master/docs/certs.md)

### Connecting a device

Xcode will prompt you to join a team, then to enable the device for development. When If you have to choose a team, choose *Art.sY Inc.*.
