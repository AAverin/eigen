This is a running document of UX, DX/code deltas between Android and iOS we find while working on app shell. Ultimately our goal is to get as close as possible to parity on the two platforms for both DX/code and UX.

The major exceptions are supporting platform specific features or if we have to sacrifice DX for UX. Meaning if we can provide a better UX by having a fork in the code base or writing platform specific code we should choose UX over DX, but we have a lot of places in the code base where we could consolidate without sacrificing UX.

DX: 

Push Notifications:
- on iOS these are handled via custom native modules and code on native side, we also have an extension for supporting rich push notifications, on Android we use an npm package, react-native-push-notification, and cofigure using a hook on login. Can we use the same library on iOS?

ImageViews:
- on iOS we use a native component AROpaqueImageView which handles things like caching for us, on Android we just use Image from react-native, can we use react-native-fast-image on both platforms?
