- we have `new-start` and `new-android` in package.json. we should merge. same for ios.
- for some reason, `tasks.whenTaskAdded` in `node_modules/react-native-config/android/dotenv.gradle` is not working.
  in upstream this function is deleted. in our fork we still have it. can we delete it? can we make it work?
- warn people that they should run `yarn cache clean` before running `yarn install:all`. we had some issues with master -> main for react-native-config
