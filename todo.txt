- we have `new-start` and `new-android` in package.json. we should merge. same for ios.
  in upstream this function is deleted. in our fork we still have it. can we delete it? can we make it work?
- warn people that they should run `yarn cache clean` before running `yarn install:all`. we had some issues with master -> main for react-native-config
- updated react-native-config patch to get source directory correct in ios folder, should be able to remove when we have just one dir
- returning same modules for native for ios as android, many are broken and will need to be fixed, may want to distinguish Android and iOS still here
- we use a hook in main App for configuring push notifications that fails on iOS, need to figure out how to use our native module instead for iOS
- pointing to the old plist in the new app, it is fine to use but will have to update path once we actually move all the code
- commit where we moved old files over - https://github.com/artsy/eigen/pull/6086/commits/783dc3ada16f1f0604805d41d63d8b711d56a27d
- added a boolean in app registry for ignoring tabs for rn modules embedded in native bc they don't have access, probably a better way to handle or give access?
- pointing to main branch for react-native-scrollable-tab-view in package.json, bc of this issue for which fix is in main but has not been released: https://github.com/ptomasroos/react-native-scrollable-tab-view/issues/1138

KNOWN ISSUES:
- The admin menu is not presentable before login, previously was a global component and this caused problems with modal presentation, now showing with standard navigate but that means it can't be presented until after login when navStack is initialized

DONE:
- bring xcode projects to a similar state
- why is the guard necessary in LiveAuctionStateReconciler but not in old app version? version mismatch somewhere? check WebSocket and network related native dependencies, change in this same commit - no longer crashing, will leave in case but not sure
- for the old app, to install pods, we rename the new `ios` folder to `new-ios` temporarily.
- we have the metaflag `newIosAppShell` to know if we should start the new or old app
- we added yarn go-old and yarn go-new to control which app to run.
- added a preprocessor macro APP_SHELL in new project, remove when ready and just use one set of logic
